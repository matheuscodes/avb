# About

Arkanos Vocabulary Builder is an Android application for browsing, training and improving vocabulary in foreign languages. It is build on top of WorNet 3.0 and uses an external translation database to compile a fuzzy network of translations with semantics, not only single worded translations.

_WordNet is a lexical database for English from Princeton. See more at http://wordnet.princeton.edu/_

_WordNet 3.0 Copyright 2006 by Princeton University. All rights reserved._

## Important notice

This application is designed to deliver offline language installation data, but none of those files were added to the source Code. The translation database used to compile the fuzzy network is public but due to terms and conditions it cannot be repackaged and delivered. All related code to connecting WordNet to this translation database and the generated files are kept out of this project. This means the current code when compiled will not be able to install the languages but will work as a simple WordNet dictionary search.

**If you are interested in using this software with its full power** please contact the author via matheus.bt at gmail.com and he will provide you the steps to obtain the data and construct the missing files for personal use.
